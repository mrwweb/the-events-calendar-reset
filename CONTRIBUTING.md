# Contributing to "The Events Calendar Reset"

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! I would love for your ideas, feedback, and additions!

## Please open issue before PR

To make sure that you don't waste any time, **[please open an issue](https://github.com/mrwweb/the-events-calendar-reset/issues) _before_ you start working on a pull request** for anything more complicated than a typo fix.

## Contribution ideas

This project is already much bigger than I want, and I hope to keep it as small and simple as possible. Two things you could definitely consider contributing:

- Suggest new [block template examples](https://github.com/mrwweb/the-events-calendar-reset/tree/main/example-block-templates) with interesting layouts
- Help me keep up with TEC's evolving CSS if there are old selectors that can be removed or new selectors that need to be added
