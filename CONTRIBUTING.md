# Contributing to "The Events Calendar Reset"

Thanks for your interest in contributing! I would love for your ideas, feedback, and additions!

## Please open issue before PR

To make sure that you don't waste any time, **please open an issue before you start working on a pull request** for anything more complicated than a typo fix.

## Contribution ideas

This project is already much bigger than I wished it were, so I hope to keep it as small and simple as possible. Two things you could definitely consider contributing:

- Suggest new block template examples with interesting layouts
- Help me keep us with TEC's evolving CSS if there are old selectors that can be removed or new selectors that need to be added
