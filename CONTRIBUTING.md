I would love for your feedback and contributions!

To make sure that you don't waste any time, **please open an issue before you start working on a pull request** for anything more complicated than a typo fix.

This project is already much bigger than I wished it were, so I hope to keep it as small and simple as possible. Probably the most interesting place to submit PRs would be new block template examples.
