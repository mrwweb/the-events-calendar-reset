# The Events Calendar v2 Template Reset & Customization Guide

Version: 2.0.2!
[Changelog](#changlog)

[Feeback encouraged!](https://mrwweb.com/contact/)

## Introduction

[The Events Calendar](https://theeventscalendar.com) (TEC) is a very powerful WordPress plugin for managing events. However, the way its templates and CSS are implemented‚Äîespecially the v2 templates‚Äîleave much to be desired.

This repository contains useful reset files and a checklist of changes I make on nearly every project that uses The Events Calendar. I wish it weren't so long!

## Who Made This?

I'm Mark Root-Wiley of [MRW Web Design](https://MRWweb.com). I build WordPress websites for nonprofits. Checkout my free resource site [Nonprofit WP](https://nonprofitwp.org) and my [free plugins](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mrwweb/#content-plugins).

## Customizations Checklist

### Styles

There are two complimentary stylesheets so that TEC inherits and uses more theme styles. This is especially powerful if you are using `/theme.json` to set colors, font sizes, and a [spacing scale](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacing-in-block-themes/).

- [ ] Use `css/tec-remap-custom-properties.scss` to override a number of TEC defaults with WP/`theme.json` defaults
  - [ ] Follow instructions in file header to review styles, customize additional properties, and delete what you won't be using
- [ ] Use `css/tec-inherit-values.scss` reset stylesheet below to get rid of numerous hard-coded values and inherit more theme styles
  - [ ] Optionally set CSS properties to match theme font sizes and colors
- [ ] Add custom styles to blocks.
  - (Optional) Reference [list of useful TEC styling selectors](<https://github.com/mrwweb/wordpress-block-editor-theme-support-starter/blob/master/third-party-blocks/the-events-calendar-front-end-blocks.css>) as starting point.

### Template Overrides

TEC provides a powerful system to override various plugin templates like the page-level templates all the way down to a specific block. Most sites will need to customize multiple templates for best results.

- [ ] Copy and customize BOTH `default-template.php` files into theme folders
  - [ ] `/tribe/events/v2/default-template.php` - Used for new Month, List, Day, etc. views
- [ ] Clean up one or both single event templates:
  - Classic Editor Events: `single-event.php`
  - Block Editor Events: `single-event-blocks.php`
- [ ] Customize additional templates as needed. Recommended accessibility fixes to templates:
  - [ ] `tribe/events/v2/list/event.php` - Datetime should follow the event's title heading for logical structure
  - [ ] `tribe/events/v2/latest-past/event.php` - Datetime should follow the event's title heading for logical structure
  - [ ] `tribe/events/blocks/event-datetime.php` - Don't use a Heading 2 for logical heading structure on single events
  - [ ] `tribe/events/v2/list/event/feature-image.php` - Apply `aria-hidden="true"` to featured image link since it's redundant with the event title link in list view

### Optional Plugins

- [ ] Fix a few things about event pages and [set a custom default block template](https://support.theeventscalendar.com/807454-Change-the-Default-Event-Template-in-Block-Editor) with mu-plugin in `mu-plugins/tec-customizations.php` in this repository
  - Customize the default block fora new Event with the `tribe_events_editor_default_template` filter. See `/example-block-templates/` for examples of block templates of various complexity
- [ ] Install [Post Type Archive Descriptions](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-archive-descriptions/) for an editable area at the top of the main events page
- [ ] Explore [additional TEC extensions](https://theeventscalendar.com/?s=&submit=&match%5Btribe_ecp_product_links%5D%5B%5D=the-events-calendar&post_type%5B%5D=tribe-extensions) for customizations (e.g., hide past events, ["tweaks" plugin](https://theeventscalendar.com/extensions/the-events-calendar-tweaks/), etc.)

## Useful v2 Design Filters

In TEC v2 templates, you can use the `tribe_template_pre_html` filter to hide specific template parts. For example, to hide the "Read More" links in list views:

```php
/* Hide "Read More" links */
add_filter( 'tribe_template_pre_html:events/v2/components/read-more', '__return_false' );
```

You can also helpfully add content before or after any template part using `tribe_template_before_include` and `tribe_template_after_include`. For example:

```php
/* Add "Hello World" after the "Views" selector in the event bar */
add_action( 'tribe_template_before_include:events/v2/components/events-bar/views', function( $file, $name, $template ) {
  echo 'Hello World';
}, 10, 3 );
```
